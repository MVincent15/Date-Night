## Description

Determining what to do on a date night can be tough. Often conversations between couples turn into "I don't know what do you want to do." There are so many places to go eat and movies to watch, but settling on something can take forever and lead to repeating the same restaurants each night and missing out movies you never would have thought to view! Enter Date Night Generator. Users enter a few fields on a form, and boom! Restaurants near you and movies to choose from. The applications remembers what you chose last, so you can see all the restaurant locations you didn't choose and generate new movies of the same genre simply by clicking submit again. 

Users can also save their last 10 selected dinner locations and movie views, so they can ensure they're trying new options each time they use the application.

# Date-Night

# User Story

As a couple
I want to figure out food and a movie for a date night
So that I have new options provided for me each date night

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a date generator website
WHEN I load website
THEN I'm prompted with 2 buttons - quiz and randomize
 and my previous movie and dinner options are pulled from local storage

WHEN I am on the site
THEN I input my current address or my location is determined by API

WHEN I click the randomize button
THEN a random movie and dinner spot are chosen for me and displayed on the screen

WHEN I click quiz button
THEN I see a short questionnaire on preferences with working back, next, and restart buttons

WHEN I answer questions
THEN the application narrows down options based on my responses

WHEN quiz is finished
THEN movie and dinner spot are chosen and displayed on the screen

WHEN I click the clear button
THEN my previous dinner and movie options are cleared from local storage


# Bonus Feature Ideas

Storing user preferences in local storage so the randomize option is more catered to the user each time
Could provide distance to restaurant, contact info, and streaming options for movies
Show total cost of date/ restrain cost by user preference


# API requirements

User's geo location (if not, we need part of the UI to accept the user's address)
Local restaurant names
Local restaurant locations
Restaurant Cuisine
Movie titles
Movie photos
